# Anime-Face-Generation-using-DCGAN
•	Trained a Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) to generate anime faces.
•	Implemented LeakyReLU activation which achieved a stable accuracy at around 64.80% for the discriminator during most of the training.
•	The loss for discriminator and generator were 0.64 and 1.10 respectively after 200 epochs.
